# Seshat-Agent
 AI-powered assistant that documents meetings automatically. Named after the ancient Egyptian goddess of writing and wisdom, Seshat uses speech recognition, language models, and integration with Notion to transcribe, summarize, analyze, and archive your meetings with minimal human input.

## Features

- **Automatic Meeting Detection:** Fetches today's meetings from your Notion database.
- **OBS Studio Integration:** Automatically starts and stops screen recording for each meeting.
- **Transcription:** Uses OpenAI Whisper to transcribe meeting recordings.
- **AI Analysis:** Summarizes, extracts action items, deadlines, decisions, and insights using Google Gemini.
- **Notion Integration:** Pushes structured meeting notes and analysis back to your Notion workspace.

## Pipeline Overview

1. **Fetch Meetings:** Reads today's meetings from Notion.
2. **Wait & Record:** Waits for each meeting to start, then launches OBS Studio and records the session.
3. **Transcribe:** Converts the recording to audio and transcribes it using Whisper.
4. **Analyze:** Sends the transcript to Gemini for summarization and extraction of key information.
5. **Document:** Creates a detailed meeting page in Notion with all extracted insights.
